# Use the graphic data selector

**GMrepo** is equipped with **two graphical data selectors** to allow users to quickly build complex queries to find **projects** and **runs** of interest; see below:

![](../images/index/query_builder_example2.png)

The selectors are a bit difficult to start with, so we provided six examples. Users can click one of the links **`Examples: #1, #2, #3`** above the selectors to view:

* the purpose of the search, e.g., `"get runs from healthy people aged 18â€“60"`,
* the selector setup, and 
* query logic in SQL command string: `"disease = 'D006262' AND host_age BETWEEN 18 AND 60"`.

## Build complex queries using the data selector

It is very easy to use the data selectors. There are three basic logics to build an efficient query:

* AND,
* OR, and
* GROUP to modify the orders of the logics.

For example, to search for samples that were taken from `healthy individuals` that are **either** American **or** British, we need to:

  * a. First build a group logic using the **ADD GROUP** button that defines the target population.
  * b. Then add two rules using the **ADD RULE** button that set `Country` to `United States of America` **OR** `United Kingdom`.
    * **Note** the logic between two rules on the `Country` is **OR**!
  * c. Then add a new rule **parallel** to the above group, and use it to select `Phenotype` as `Health`.
    * **Note** the logic between the `Phenotype` and the `Country` group is **AND**!

The resulting graphical selector and the query logic are shown below:

More examples will be added in the future.
